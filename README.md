#Web-SOAP

This project has front-end and db-only backend(Google Spreadsheet), use gulp with dev-prod structure.

After building, just deploy the generated 'dist' folder as same as static website.

(You can see my another incomplete project [Google_Spreadsheet_RESTful](https://github.com/David-Tsui/Google_Spreadsheet_RESTful) to get the info of 

making Google Spreadsheet as a database.)

###How to use
```
npm install

gulp assets build

gulp
```
Then open port 8080 to see the result, with gulp's watching and livereload.

(You'll need to install Google Chrome livereload extension first)

###About
This project was coded by jquery with mess, the thought of reusing it seems to be a daydream.

I recommend use Vue.js and some useful JS libs to rewrite than maintain it.

Cheers.
